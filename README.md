### Screenshot

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live site URL here](https://four-card-section-livid.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I enhanced my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox, which are powerful layout systems in CSS. I also got more comfortable with the mobile-first approach, which ensures the design is responsive and works well on all device sizes.

Here's a code snippet I'm particularly proud of:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on advanced CSS techniques and exploring JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js. Additionally, I aim to refine my understanding of responsive design and accessibility to create more inclusive web applications.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This guide helped me understand CSS Grid layout.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An excellent resource for web development concepts and documentation.
